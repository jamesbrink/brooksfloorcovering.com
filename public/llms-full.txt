### Carpet Flooring

Carpet flooring offers unmatched comfort, warmth, and style for both residential and commercial spaces. We provide expertly selected and professionally installed carpet floors that combine performance, beauty, and long-term value. Our carpet installation services include commercial glue-down carpet for high-traffic environments, modular carpet tile for offices and contemporary spaces, and traditional stretch-in carpet with pad for residential comfort.

We offer a full range of carpet styles including patterned, Berber, plush, level loop, and textured options. Fiber choices include nylon for durability, PET polyester for softness and stain resistance, wool for premium luxury, and recycled eco-friendly materials. Our office-friendly installation approach allows carpet tile installation in active office environments with minimal to no disassembly of cubicles.

### Tile Flooring

Tile flooring is one of the smartest investments for any home or business, combining exceptional durability with endless design versatility. We install ceramic, porcelain, and natural stone tile for kitchens, bathrooms, entryways, and commercial spaces. Tile is resistant to scratches, dents, moisture, and heavy foot traffic, and with proper installation and care can last for decades.

Our tile installation process includes consultation and design selection, site preparation with subfloor inspection, careful layout planning for balanced spacing and clean lines, professional installation with precision spacing and alignment, grouting and finishing, and a final walkthrough. Layout options include herringbone, chevron, stacked, and staggered patterns for a truly customized result.

### Luxury Vinyl Plank (LVP)

Luxury Vinyl Plank flooring delivers the perfect balance of beauty, durability, and everyday practicality. LVP is engineered to replicate the look of natural hardwood, concrete, and tile while offering waterproof protection, scratch resistance, and low-maintenance performance. Many products include built-in underlayment for added comfort and sound absorption.

LVP is ideal for kitchens, bathrooms, offices, and anywhere life happens. Design options range from rustic oak and classic maple to modern gray tones and wide-plank styles. Our installation process includes personalized consultation, site evaluation and subfloor preparation, precision plank installation with proper spacing and expansion gaps, trim and transition finishing, and care guidance.

### Engineered Hardwood

Wood flooring brings warmth, character, and lasting value to any space. We install both solid hardwood and engineered wood flooring using nail-down, glue-down, and floating installation methods. Solid hardwood is made from a single piece of wood and can be sanded and refinished multiple times. Engineered wood features a real wood veneer over a high-performance plywood core, providing superior stability for basements, concrete subfloors, and areas with moisture or temperature changes.

Wood species options include Oak (Red & White), Maple, Hickory, Walnut, Cherry, and exotic woods. We offer both prefinished and unfinished wood floors, with finishing options including custom staining, protective coatings, and multiple sheen levels from matte to high-gloss.

### Polished Concrete

Polished concrete is a modern, high-performance flooring solution that blends durability with refined design. Once reserved mainly for industrial spaces, polished concrete has become a sought-after option for homes, retail spaces, offices, and commercial facilities. The existing concrete slab is used as the finished surface, eliminating the need for additional floor coverings and making it a cost-effective, sustainable choice.

Our polished concrete process includes surface preparation, progressive grinding with industrial diamond grinders, densifier application to harden the surface, fine polishing to the selected sheen level, and protective sealer application. Design options include matte, satin, or high-gloss finishes, varying levels of aggregate exposure, coloring and staining, and decorative saw cuts or patterns.

### Epoxy Flooring

Epoxy flooring is a high-performance, seamless flooring solution for residential, commercial, and industrial spaces. It is designed to withstand heavy foot traffic, machinery, impacts, and abrasions while delivering a clean, modern, and customizable look. Epoxy floors are chemical and moisture resistant, making them ideal for garages, warehouses, showrooms, commercial kitchens, aircraft hangars, and industrial facilities.

We offer multiple epoxy systems: 3-coat solid color epoxy for a clean professional look, metallic epoxy for a stunning three-dimensional appearance, quartz epoxy for textured slip-resistant surfaces, and flake epoxy for decorative texture and color variation. Top coat options include urethane for chemical resistance and flexibility, and polyaspartic for fast curing and superior UV resistance.

### Floor Preparation

Great floors start with proper preparation. We provide professional floor preparation services designed to create a smooth, level, and durable foundation for any flooring system. Our services include concrete grinding and surface profiling, adhesive and coating removal, moisture mitigation systems, waterproofing systems for bathrooms and wet areas, self-leveling underlayment, crack isolation systems, and laser-guided floor leveling for the highest level of accuracy.

These preparation services support installations of tile, hardwood, vinyl, epoxy, and resilient and specialty flooring systems. We use industrial-grade equipment and manufacturer-approved systems to meet project specifications and ensure long-term performance.

### Custom Tile Showers

A custom tile shower is a statement piece, a daily luxury, and a long-term investment in your home. We design and install fully customized tile showers with complete creative freedom in material selection including ceramic, porcelain, glass, and natural stone tile. Every shower we build is tailored to the homeowner's space, style, and lifestyle.

Our installation process includes detailed planning and design, shower pan liner installation for moisture protection, hand-built mud shower pans with perfect slope to the drain, cement backer board installation, full waterproofing membrane application, custom seats, benches, and recessed niches, and precision tile installation with professional grouting and sealing. We focus on what is behind the tile just as much as what is visible, ensuring long-term performance and moisture protection.
