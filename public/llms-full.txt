Before installation day, we recommend clearing furniture and personal items from the rooms being worked on. Remove wall decorations and fragile items near the work area. Ensure the work area is accessible and that pets and children are kept away from the installation zone. Our team will handle the rest, including removing old flooring if that is part of your project scope. We provide detailed preparation instructions during your free estimate appointment.
